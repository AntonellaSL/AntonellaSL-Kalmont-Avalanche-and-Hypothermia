          Staying safe on a ski mountain requires a combination of awareness,
          preparedness, and responsible decision-making. First and foremost,
          it's crucial to adhere to all posted signs and guidelines provided by
          the ski resort. Before hitting the slopes, ensure your equipment is
          properly fitted and in good condition. Always wear a helmet and
          appropriate protective gear. Maintain control of your speed and skiing
          or snowboarding within your abilities.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-style-1">
          Keep an eye out for other skiers or snowboarders, yielding to those
          downhill and maintaining a safe distance. Be mindful of changing
          weather conditions and terrain variations, adjusting your technique
          accordingly. Additionally, familiarize yourself with the mountain's
          layout and potential hazards, such as cliffs, trees, or hidden
          obstacles. Finally, never venture off-piste alone, and consider taking
          avalanche safety courses if exploring backcountry terrain.

            <p>
              Staying safe in avalanche terrain requires a combination of
              knowledge, preparation, and prudent decision-making. Before
              heading into avalanche-prone areas, it's crucial to check
              avalanche forecasts and understand the current snowpack
              conditions. Equipping oneself with essential avalanche safety gear
              such as transceivers, probes, and shovels, and knowing how to
              properly use them, is paramount. Traveling with a knowledgeable
              partner or group, practicing safe route-finding techniques, and
              avoiding steep slopes during times of heightened avalanche danger
              are essential strategies.

          <li class="card">
            <img src="img/1.png" alt="1" width="30" height="30" />
            <p>
              Low: Avalanches are unlikely except in isolated terrain features.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="card">
            <img src="img/2.png" alt="1" width="30" height="30" />
            <p>
              Moderate: Avalanches are possible on specific slopes. Evaluate
              terrain carefully, and practice cautious route selection.

              3. Extreme: Widespread and large avalanches are certain, making
              travel in avalanche terrain extremely dangerous and not advisable.

              4. High: Widespread avalanches are probable, even on moderate
              slopes. Travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended.

              5. Considerable: Avalanches are likely on many steep slopes.
              Heightened awareness and conservative decision-making are
              essential.

        <h2>Hypothermia</h2>
        <p>
          Staying safe from hypothermia is crucial, especially in cold
          environments or during outdoor activities in chilly weather.
          <strong>
            Prevent this potentially life-threatening condition, it's essential
            to dress warmly in layers, covering exposed skin and wearing a hat
            to minimize heat loss from the head.</strong
          >
          Keeping dry is equally important; moisture can accelerate heat loss
          from the body.
        </p>
        <p>
          If outdoors, seek shelter from the wind and cold, and avoid
          overexertion, which can lead to sweating and subsequently cooling down
          too quickly.
          <strong>
            Stay hydrated and nourished, as proper hydration and nutrition help
            maintain body temperature.</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          If someone shows signs of hypothermia such as shivering, confusion,
          slurred speech, or drowsiness,
          <strong>
            it's crucial to act quickly by getting them to a warm
            environment,</strong
          >
          removing wet clothing, and providing insulation and warmth through
          blankets or body heat. Seek medical attention promptly if symptoms
          persist or worsen.
        </p>

        <p>
          Being prepared and aware of the risks can significantly reduce the
          likelihood of hypothermia-related incidents.
