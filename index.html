				<div class="container">
					<h2 class="label">What is HTML?</h2>
					<p class="content">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a computer language that makes up most web pages and online applications. A hypertext is a text that is used to reference other pieces of text, while a markup language is a series of markings that tells web servers the style and structure of a document. HTML is very simple to learn and use.</p>
				</div>
				<hr>
	
				<div class="container">
					<h2 class="label">What is CSS?</h2>
					<p class="content">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colours, layout, and fonts, thus making our web pages presentable to the users. CSS is designed to make style sheets for the web. It is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. CSS is popularly called the design language of the web.
					</p>
				</div>
				<hr>
	
				<div class="container">
					<h2 class="label">What is Javascript?</h2>
					<p class="content">JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third of the web trio.
					</p>
				</div>
				<hr>
	
				<div class="container">
					<h2 class="label">What is React?</h2>
					<p class="content">React is a JavaScript library created for building fast and interactive user interfaces for web and mobile applications. It is an open-source, component-based, front-end library responsible only for the application’s view layer. In Model View Controller (MVC) architecture, the view layer is responsible for how the app looks and feels. React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. 
					</p>
				</div>
				<hr>
	
				<div class="container">
					<h2 class="label">What is PHP?</h2>
					<p class="content">PHP is a server-side and general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development. PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page. However, now, it stands for Hypertext Preprocessor. It’s a recursive acronym because the first word itself is also an acronym.

						<a href="/">Weather Report</a> to check current avalanche danger and forecast for the next day.

				<div class="container">
					<h4 class="questions">What tools do I need to be prepared for an Avalanche?</h4>
					<p class="answers"> To be prepared for an avalanche, you'll need essential tools including an avalanche transceiver (also known as a beacon) to locate buried victims, a probe for pinpointing their exact location under the snow, and a sturdy shovel for rapid excavation. Additionally, having knowledge of avalanche safety protocols, including recognizing avalanche terrain, understanding snowpack stability, and practicing effective rescue techniques, is crucial. It's also advisable to carry avalanche airbags for added protection and to mitigate burial depth in case of an avalanche. Regular training and practice with these tools and techniques are essential for staying safe in avalanche-prone areas. Additionally, always check local avalanche forecasts and weather conditions before venturing into the backcountry.

				<div class="container">
					<h4 class="questions">I have witnessed an avalanche. Where can I report it?</h4>
					<p class="answers"> If you have witnessed an avalanche, it's crucial to report it to the relevant authorities immediately. Contact your local emergency services or search and rescue team, providing them with as much detail as possible about the location, size, and any potential victims involved. Additionally, if you're in a recreational area, inform park rangers or officials responsible for that area. Quick reporting can expedite rescue efforts and help prevent further accidents or injuries.

				<div class="container">
					<h4 class="questions">Recommended response to avalanche disasters</h4>
					<p class="answers"> In response to avalanche disasters, swift and coordinated actions are imperative to minimize casualties and mitigate further harm. Immediate priorities include deploying search and rescue teams equipped with specialized training and equipment to locate and extract victims trapped under snow. Concurrently, communication channels should be activated to warn and evacuate individuals in vulnerable areas while also providing timely updates to the public and coordinating with relevant authorities. Additionally, post-disaster measures should focus on conducting thorough assessments of the affected region to ensure the safety of remaining individuals and to initiate recovery efforts, including infrastructure repair and psychological support for survivors and affected communities. Collaborative efforts between government agencies, emergency responders, and local communities are essential for an effective response to avalanche disasters.

				<div class="container">	
					<h4 class="questions">How do I contact Avalanche rescue?</h4>
					<p class="answers"> To contact Avalanche rescue, dial the emergency services number (911). Provide your location with coordinates if possible, the number of people involved, and any other relevant information such as injuries or equipment you have. If you're in a remote area without cellular service, activating a personal locator beacon (PLB) or satellite messenger device can also alert authorities to your situation and location. It's crucial to remain calm, conserve energy, and create air pockets if buried while awaiting rescue.
